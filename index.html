            <h2>Bengal Cat</h2>
            <p>Known for their striking spotted coats and energetic personalities, Bengal cats are a blend of domestic and wild feline traits. The Bengal cat is a hybrid breed originating in the United States, created by crossing the Asian leopard cat (Prionailurus bengalensis) with domestic cats, 
            such as the Egyptian Mau and Abyssinian, to develop a distinct feline. Appearance-wise, Bengals feature coats with spots, rosettes, arrowhead markings, or marbling, making them the only domestic breed with rosette patterns; they also have longer rear legs and carry their tails low.</p>
            <p>In personality, they are bred to exhibit a friendly demeanor, often requiring crosses with sociable domestic breeds to ensure kittens manifest this trait, as wildcat ancestry may otherwise influence behavior. Rare aspects include their hybrid status, with early generations (F1-F3) considered foundation
            stock and sometimes infertile in males; some Bengals carry a recessive long-hair gene, resulting in semi-long-haired variants known as Cashmere Bengals, which are gaining recognition in registries like TICA since 2017.</p>

            <h2>Savannah Cat</h2>
            <p>The Savannah cat is a striking hybrid breed known for its tall, slender build and spotted coat, resembling a wild serval. Originating from a cross between a domestic cat and a serval, Savannahs are known for their intelligence, curiosity, and energetic nature.</p>
            <p>The Savannah cat is a hybrid breed originating in the United States from crossing a serval (Leptailurus serval) with a domestic cat (Felis catus), first produced in 1986 by Judee Frank. Appearance-wise, it features a tall, lean build with large erect ears, long legs, 
            a long slender neck, small head, and spotted coat in patterns like brown-spotted tabby or silver-spotted tabby, often with ocelli on ears, tear-streak markings, and a short ringed tail. Size varies by generation and sex; F1 and F2 males can reach up to 48.4 cm in height 
            and over 18 kg, while F4–F5 cats weigh 5.0–8.2 kg, comparable to large domestic breeds like Maine Coon. Personality includes loyalty, following owners, leash training, fetching, and affinity for water play, though early generations may show territorial behaviors, aggression, 
            or litter box issues. Rare aspects involve its hybrid nature, with F1–F2 males sterile due to genetic incompatibilities, high serval percentages in backcrosses (up to 87.5%), and legal restrictions in places like Australia and New Zealand due to potential wildlife threats.</p>

            <h2>Chausie Cat</h2>
            <p>The Chausie is a domestic cat breed developed by crossing the jungle cat (Felis chaus), native to Southeast Asia, India, the Middle East, and North Africa's Nile Delta, with domestic cats (Felis catus). Hybrids likely originated in ancient Egypt,
             where both species coexisted, with modern breeding starting in the late 1960s and formalized in the 1990s by dedicated breeders. Recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1995 as a non-domestic hybrid source breed, it achieved championship status in 2013.
             Appearance-wise, Chausies are medium to large, with males weighing 11-16 pounds (5.0-7.3 kg) and females 8-13 pounds (3.6-5.9 kg). They have long, leggy bodies, deep chests, broad ears set high, prominent cheekbones, and flattened half-oval eyes. Coat colors are limited to 
             solid black, black grizzled tabby, and black ticked tabby, with gold or yellow eye color preferred. The grizzled and ticked patterns, unique to Chausies due to jungle cat ancestry, develop over time, often starting black in kittens and showing banded or ticked hairs by adulthood.
             In personality, Chausies are intelligent, active, and athletic, bred from outgoing breeds like the Abyssinian and Oriental Shorthair. They are playful, curious, and form deep bonds with people, disliking being alone and getting along with dogs if raised together. However, they may 
             be prone to food allergies due to shorter intestinal tracts from non-domestic ancestors, requiring high-quality, low-plant-ingredient diets. Rare aspects include its hybrid origins, making it one of few domestic breeds with wild cat lineage, and unique black-on-black tabby patterns not found in purely domestic cats.</p>
